### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > pwd : shows current working directory path (stands for print working directory).  
    mkdir : creates a directory.  
    rmdir : deletes a directory.   
    touch : quick and easy way to create a new file (also is capable of updating the access date to a file, just happens to create a new file if it doesn't already exist).   
    rm : removes a file.   
    mv : moves (renames) a file.   
    ls -a : lists hidden files.   
    cp : copies one file from one directory to another.   
    pushd: bookmarks my current location and moves to whatever location was specified.   
    popd : "pops" back to the location bookmarked by pushd.   
    less : prints the contents of a file on a new page, "space" to scroll, "q" to quit/escape back to prompt.
