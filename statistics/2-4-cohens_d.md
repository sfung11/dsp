[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> ```python
print(CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb))
firsts.totalwgt_lb.std(), others.totalwgt_lb.std() 
```
Cohen's d allows one to compare the difference between groups to the variability between groups. The resulting value unit is number of standard deviations.
Cohen's d for total weight (in pounds) tells us that first children are lighter than other children by about 0.089 pounds, or 1.419 oz.
